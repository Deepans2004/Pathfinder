Welcome to the Path Finder Application! This project demonstrates the implementation of pathfinding algorithms in Java. It finds the shortest path between two points on a grid, considering various obstacles and providing visual feedback.

## Features

- **A* Algorithm**: Efficient pathfinding using heuristics.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Reliable shortest path algorithm.
- **Interactive GUI**: Visual representation of the grid and the pathfinding process.
- **Customizable Grid**: Users can add obstacles and set start/end points.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
- A Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.)
